  Matt and Ross Duffer, the twin masterminds who wrote and directed Netflix's
  Eighties nostalgiafest Stranger Things, have a confession: They're sorta
  Nineties kids. The North Carolina-bred brothers were born in 1984 - a year
  after the show's setting - and, while they have murky recollections of Cold
  War anxiety, they grew up playing Magic: The Gathering more than Dungeons &
  Dragons.
